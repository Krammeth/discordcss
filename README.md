I had a theme here, but it was out of date, bad and as of recently, performance got tanked.. so:
For a while you can find it under /archive while I create something new eventually.

I'm slowly reworking the snippets, targeting discord's visual refresh.

No warranty, no promises for support.  
Any/all functionality and look of all css within this repository might change without any warning at any time.  
The Vencord plugin "ThemeAttributes" should be enabled for best experience.  

To use the theme or snippets:  
Grab the "raw" links to the files, example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvhhr/discordcss/main/snippets/dashless-extended.theme.css - and drop the links into your Vencord online themes.  
Other client modifications should work too for the most part but YMMV.  
Check out the readme under the snippets directory.  

Alternatively, download the file and put it in your theme folder or copypaste it into your quickCSS.  
That way you'll be able to make any changes locally, and I won't be able to break your stuff but you won't get my fixes either.
