*Image might not always reflect current state of the theme or what it will look like for you.*

I have separated many of its features as files that should work on their own, and I'm trying to make comments in the css so hopefully you can learn how it all works.  
Also will be adding snippets that aren't included with the theme.  
I'll be making presets for many different looks based on this base theme, stay tuned.

This repository is still in a stage where things might change in major ways without warning, so:  
No warranty, no promises for support.  
Any/all functionality and look of all css here might change without any warning at any time.  
**The Vencord plugin "ThemeAttributes" should be enabled for best experience.**  
I'm only really testing this on Vesktop but I try to maintain compatibility with Discord stable.

To use the theme or snippets:  
Grab the "raw" links to the files (main theme: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvhhr/discordcss/main/flexible.theme.css and for snippets or presets for an example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvhhr/discordcss/main/snippets/dashless-extended.theme.css) and drop the links into your Vencord online themes.  

Alternatively, download the file and put it in your theme folder or copypaste it into your quickCSS.  
That way you'll be able to make any changes locally, and I won't be able to break your stuff while this is still evolving.

Theme should work mostly fine on other client mods also, but the imports in the theme might not work (because I'm not using github.io, raw links are served text/plain when .io links are text/css), so you might have to add in the snippet components as extra themes. This may change in the future.
