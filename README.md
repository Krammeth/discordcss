Sharing my theme here soonâ„¢, separating many of its features as separate files that should work on their own, as well as making presets for many different looks based on one base theme.

No warranty, no promises for support.
Any/all functionality and look of all css here might change without any warning at any time.
The Vencord plugin "ThemeAttributes" should be enabled.

To use the snippets:
Grab the "raw" links to the files (like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvhhr/discordcss/main/snippets/dashless-extended.theme.css) and drop them into your Vencord online themes.
Alternatively, download the file and put it in your theme folder or copypaste it into your quickCSS. That way you'll be able to make any changes locally, and I won't be able to break your stuff while this is evolving.
