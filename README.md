Sharing my theme here, separating some of its features as separate files that should work on their own.

No support will be given, and any/all functionality and look of all css here might change without any warning at any time.

Everything will only be tested on [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop), and Discord desktop client will not work due to its old version of Electron/Chromium.

The plugin "ThemeAttributes" should be enabled.
