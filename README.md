#discord css
I had a theme here, but it was out of date, bad and as of recently, performance got tanked.. so:
For a while you can find it under /archive while I create something new.

I'm also reworking the snippets, targeting discord's visual refresh that's finally being rolled out.

This repository is still in a stage where things might change in major ways without warning, so:  
No warranty, no promises for support.  
Any/all functionality and look of all css within this repository might change without any warning at any time.  
**The Vencord plugin "ThemeAttributes" should be enabled for best experience.**  

To use the theme or snippets:  
Grab the "raw" links to the files (main theme: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvhhr/discordcss/main/flexible.theme.css and for snippets or presets for an example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvhhr/discordcss/main/snippets/dashless-extended.theme.css) and drop the links into your Vencord online themes.  

Alternatively, download the file and put it in your theme folder or copypaste it into your quickCSS.  
That way you'll be able to make any changes locally, and I won't be able to break your stuff while this is still evolving.

Theme should work mostly fine on other client mods also, but the imports in the theme might not work (because I'm not using github.io, raw links are served text/plain when .io links are text/css), so you might have to add in the snippet components as extra themes. This may change in the future.
