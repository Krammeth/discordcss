Sharing my theme here (soon), separating some of its features as separate files that should work on their own.

No warranty, no promise for support. YMMV.  
Any and all functionality and look of all css here might change without any warning at any time.

Everything will only be tested on [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop), Discord desktop client will not work due to its old version of Electron/Chromium.  
The Vencord plugin "ThemeAttributes" should be enabled.

Grab the "raw" links to the files (like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvhhr/discordcss/main/snippets/dashless-extended.theme.css) and drop them into your Vencord online themes.
